WINDOWS
-------

1. Download the iperf source code (or git clone)
 * Download and extract the iperf source code to Cygwin...


2. Configure the compiler
 * Start the Cygwin shell from the start menu or the shortcut on your desktop.

 * Enter the directory where you extracted the iperf source
 	cd /iperf-2.0.5

 * Configure the compiler (this might take a couple minutes)
 	./configure   or better:
	./configure --program-suffix=6FP --enable-static --disable-shared


3.  Compile the source
 * To get the compile process started just type make and hit enter.  It shouldn’t take very long for the compile to finish.
 	make


4.  Make install
 * Assuming your build completed without errors your going to want to run ‘make install’, to do this just type make install in the shell and hit enter.  
 	make install
 * As you can see from the output below iperf.exe was copied to /usr/local/bin/


5.  Running iperf
 * You can run iperf directly from the Cygwin environment but you will have to specify the full path to the executable eg: /usr/local/bin/iperf.  
   If you prefer to run iperf directly from a Windows command prompt or from another machine you can copy the iperf binary and the nessasary DLL files out of the cygwin environment.

 * If you installed Cygwin to the default location then iperf.exe will be located in C:\cygwin\usr\local\bin

 * You will also need the following DLL files found in C:\cygwin\bin.
 	cygwin1.dll
 	cyggcc_s-1.dll
 	cygstdc++-6.dll
 	Copy the three DLL files and iperf.exe somewhere on your system that is in your path like c:\windows\system32 for example.  You can then run iperf directly from a command prompt.




LINUX

* Compiled on RPi2/3:
 	cd /iperf-3.6.Z
 	./configure --program-suffix=6FP
 	make
 	make install

NOTE: You can force static compil using the options --enable-static --disable-shared

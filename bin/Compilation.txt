1. Download the iperf source code (or git clone)

Next download and extract the iperf source code to Cygwin...


2. Configure the compiler

Start the Cygwin shell from the start menu or the shortcut on your desktop.

Enter the directory where you extracted the iperf source

cd /iperf-2.0.5

Configure the compiler (this might take a couple minutes)

./configure


3.  Compile the source

To get the compile process started just type make and hit enter.  It shouldn’t take very long for the compile to finish.


4.  Make install

Assuming your build completed without errors your going to want to run ‘make install’, to do this just type make install in the shell and hit enter.  As you can see from the output below iperf.exe was copied to /usr/local/bin/


5.  Running iperf

You can run iperf directly from the Cygwin environment but you will have to specify the full path to the executable eg: /usr/local/bin/iperf.  If you prefer to run iperf directly from a Windows command prompt or from another machine you can copy the iperf binary and the nessasary DLL files out of the cygwin environment.

If you installed Cygwin to the default location then iperf.exe will be located in C:\cygwin\usr\local\bin


You will also need the following DLL files found in C:\cygwin\bin.
cygwin1.dll
cyggcc_s-1.dll
cygstdc++-6.dll
Copy the three DLL files and iperf.exe somewhere on your system that is in your path like c:\windows\system32 for example.  You can then run iperf directly from a command prompt.
